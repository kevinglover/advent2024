# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains my daily coding challenges solved in **Python**.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is organized in `day-X/part-Y/` folders (e.g., `day-1/part-1/` for December 1st, Part 1).
- Each folder contains:
  - `main.py`: The Python script for the solution.
  - `data.txt`: The puzzle input for that part.
 
## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the respective folder and execute the script:

```bash
cd day-X/part-Y
python main.py
```

Happy coding! ðŸŽ…âœ¨
